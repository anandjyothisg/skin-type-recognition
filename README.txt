Skin Type Recognition Using TensorFlow and OpenCV
This project is a real-time skin type recognition system that leverages TensorFlow for machine learning and OpenCV for live video detection. It captures live video feeds, analyzes the user's skin, and classifies the skin type in real-time. This application can be used for personalized skincare recommendations, beauty product selection, or dermatological assessments.


Features
Real-Time Detection: Continuously captures video from your webcam and classifies your skin type as the video streams.
TensorFlow-Powered Classification: Utilizes a pre-trained neural network model built with TensorFlow to classify skin types.
OpenCV Integration: Incorporates OpenCV to capture live video and handle image processing tasks.
Accurate Skin Type Classification: The model is trained to detect and classify skin types like oily, dry, combination, sensitive, and normal.
User-Friendly: Real-time classification displayed live on the video feed for immediate results.


Requirements
To run this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
OpenCV 4.x
Numpy
Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing data)


You can install the required libraries with:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib


How It Works
Live Video Capture: OpenCV accesses your system's webcam to capture live video frames.
Skin Type Detection: Each frame is passed through a trained TensorFlow model to classify the skin type.
Real-Time Display: The skin type is displayed on the live video feed in real-time, updating as the frame changes.
Steps to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/skin-type-recognition.git
cd skin-type-recognition
Install the required dependencies using the command mentioned above.

Run the skin_type_recognition.py script:

bash
Copy code
python skin_type_recognition.py
The webcam will open, and the live feed will show your skin type classification in real-time.
Model Training
The skin type classifier model was built using TensorFlow and trained on a dataset consisting of various skin types. The training process involved:
Data preprocessing: Normalizing images, augmenting data.
Model architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for skin-type classification.
Optimization and accuracy improvements through fine-tuning and hyperparameter tuning.
For details on how the model was trained or to retrain it with your own dataset, refer to the model_training.py script in the repository.


Future Improvements
Enhanced Accuracy: Further training with a larger, more diverse dataset to improve classification accuracy.
Mobile Integration: Adapting the model to work on mobile platforms with live camera feeds.
Skincare Suggestions: Implementing a module to provide personalized skincare product recommendations based on skin type.
